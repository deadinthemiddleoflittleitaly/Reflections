When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To share with the world!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Maybe someone added code that will break your work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork to take someone else's code for your own use.  Clone to make a copy of
    your own code.  Branch to add a new feature.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You may not want to merge the code yet but being able to merge later
    while offline is possible.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Emails and fileshares.  Git would organize a lot of this but some of this stuff seems a little complex.  I'm sure over time I'll get better though.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
